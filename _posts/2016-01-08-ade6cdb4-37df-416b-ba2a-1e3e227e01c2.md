LOG ON - LOG OFF

On the architecture of consciousness interfaces and the ideal User Interface

Unlimited intelligence is Managing the Matrix. In order to learn, it has fragmented itself into dualities and separated sub-programs.

Each sub-program has a specific "purpose" or role, on which its user experience is based. A fly obviously has to have a very different consciousness from a sloth, or the program that manages the weather or a sea ecosystem. 

In the case of the fly or the amoeba, we also have to consider the significant intelligence loss. While logging on to the fly, the majority of unlimited power and intelligence is shed and remains in the program core, all memories are lost, thus providing a true "fly" experience.

How does unlimited intelligence avoid an entrapment through subjective perception of time? Is there an escape button that allows consciousness at any intelligence level to recognise that it's not enjoying the ride and thus logging off that specific experience, returning the management of the fly to the Core or a Fly Race Group Consciousness?

I think this would make sense. Without committing suicide. A mechanism that allows return to Source at any time, any moment, without the need for anything external. A secret button, hidden somewhere inside the organism. A mechanism that can be intuitively understood by even the most rudimentary conscious beingness.
