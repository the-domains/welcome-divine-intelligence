Is it really necessary to work in the classical definition?

Or is the duality of work vs. fun essentially a limiting belief system?

What is work? It's usually what we do during the day to earn a living and make money. I assume it is not what people appreciate most in their lives but rather a means to an end, something not performed with love, but rather a certain sobriety.

There are some interesting points regarding this, from the Bhagavad Gita:

Krishna said:
(...)
One does not attain freedom from the bondage of Karma 
by merely abstaining from work.
No one attains perfection by merely giving up work. \[Makes sense...\]
  
Because no one can remain actionless even for a moment.
Everyone is driven to action, helplessly indeed,
by the Gunas of nature.   
\[Guna: 'string, thread or strand' or 'quality, peculiarity, attribute, property'\]
  
The deluded ones, who restrain their organs of action
but mentally dwell upon the sense enjoyment,
are called hypocrites. \[Hedonists, I wonder?\]
  
(...)
  
As the ignorant work, O Arjuna,
with attachment (to the fruits of work),
so the wise should work without attachment,
for the welfare of the society.
  
The wise should not unsettle the mind of the ignorant
who is attached to the fruits of work,
but the enlightened one should inspire others
by performing all works efficiently without attachment.
  
All works are being done by the Gunas of nature,
but due to delusion of ego
people assume themselves to be the doer.
The one who knows the truth, O Arjuna,
about the role of Guna and action
does not get attached to the work,
knowing that it is the Gunas that work
with their instruments, the organs.
  
(...)
  
Dedicating all works to Me
in a spiritual frame of mind, free from desire,
attachment, and mental grief, do your duty.
  
(...)
  
All beings follow their nature.
Even the wise act according to their own nature.
What, then, is the value of sense restraint?
Raga and Dvesha (or the attachments and aversions)
for the sense objects remain in the senses.
One should not come under the control of these two,
because they are two stumbling blocks, indeed,
on one's path of Self-realization.
  
One's inferior natural work is better
than superior unnatural work.
Death in carrying out one's natural work is useful.
  
Unnatural work produces too much stress."

Especially the aspect of becoming attached to the fruit of one's labor and the aspect of "unnatural work" are important. Aren't we always attached to the fruit of our work (our paycheck at the end of the month)?

Would we continue to work knowing that there is no fruit?

What would be our work if we simply followed our nature? Are we therefore doing unnatural work?

What if the fruit is in reality created by the gunas (the universe) based on the amount of dedication and love in everything we perform, and not (like society makes us believe) on hard work?

Could doing what we love and following our own nature thus yield more than doing something unnatural that we think we have to do for the money? There may not be a direct perceivable cause-effect relationship like the paycheck or a customer paying their bill, since All-is-God the fruit could come from virtually anywhere with no seeming connection.
