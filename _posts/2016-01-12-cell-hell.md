What is the metaphysical effect of contantly being hooked to our cellphones?

I wondered about it because it becomes really obvious in a club, where people are dancing.

Cellphones destroy athmosphere.

Cellphones
open a gate to "elsewhere" and potentially "another time" - we are not 
here and now anymore and become completely oblivious to our 
surroundings. 

It also kills the energy around us and leaves a kind of dead spot where that person's energy used to fill space.

A
guy said about this "with the cellphone you are signaling that there 
are more important things somewhere else, not here, not now," and "Be 
here now. You are the most important person for yourself, not somebody 
else far away"

Does coincidence and synchronicity utilize facebook or is it rather employing our direct environment? 

Is the constant usage of the smartphone thus cutting us off from realizing our full potential?

Then
even listening to our own music, shutting the audio channel off from 
our environment may already severely limit our receptivity to important 
input, instead we are constantly in a closed-system loop listening to 
what we already know and like.
