TO DO LIST OF OPEN QUESTIONS

- Are there any rules to this game?

- Who sets the rules? Me or something external?

- Hierarchy of rules - LOVE - FREE WILL - BELIEF?

- Is it possible to construct a universe not based on love? Is there a universal failsafe?

- The end of all suffering - how scarcity and suffering is just a random choice that can be altered any instant

- Thy will be done. But how do I know what thy will is?
