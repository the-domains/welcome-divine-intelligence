Ritualising the mundane

How do we shift from a science and detailed-based left-brain worldview into a unity-based, ritualistic attitude?

Where, instead of managing nitty gritty details without being able to understand the overall outcome, we act without acting, by communicating to the universe our desires through intention and ritual?

Like in Food: Who knows what the interactions of the myriad of ingredients of the food we ingest cause (at different times, in different combinations, different metabolic types,...)?

Instead, there must be a way of upgrading the "Management Cockpit" from Managing details to communicating goals. Let the universe figure out how to achieve it.

Like on a game board. Move the tower from the lower right corner to the lower left corner. That changes the entire architecture of the (game) universe.
